# Build a Website with Laravel

This project documents the entire process of me developing a website that sells APIs.

It is not a small project, but a complete project that can run in a production environment.

Building such a project takes a long time, so please make sure you have enough patience.

Currently, this project is still in the development stage.

## Why

Why do I write such a series of articles?

- To summarize the knowledge I have learned since I have studied in this field for many years
- To improve my English writing skills
- Very few public tutorials that describe the complete knowledge system. Most of them only talk about a small aspect
- My girlfriend wants to learn and she asked me to write a series of articles(She knows nothing about this field)

The most import reason is:

❗️❗️❗️To help others who want to learn this knowledge.

🎉🎉🎉 It would be my great honor if it can help you.
